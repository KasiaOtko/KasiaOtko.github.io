      <description>Socio-economical background for African conflicts Africa is the 2nd largest and 2nd most populated continent in the world - about 30.3 million km2 covers 6% of Earth&amp;rsquo;s total surface area [1]. With 1.3 billion people [2] as of 2018, it is about 16% of the world&amp;rsquo;s human population. Even with a wide range of natural resources, Africa stays the world&amp;rsquo;s poorest and least-developed continent. This is the result of a variety of causes which include corrupt governments that have often committed serious human rights violations, failed central planning, high levels of illiteracy, lack of access to foreign capital, and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from guerrilla warfare to genocide) [3].</description>

      <description>Temporal patterns In this section we will dive deeper into different dimensions of this dataset and present the most interesting findings. We will start by investigating the temporal patterns of each of the conflict types. Can we observe any intresting trends in case of some of them?
We decided to use a combination of a line plot with a bar plot to present the relationships between average number of deaths and number of events in time.</description>

      <description>In order to learn more about the conflicts we decided to make use of the short summary of each of the events that stores the most important details surrounding the event that can give us more context. To analyse it, we preprocessed the text data and created word clouds to discover the main themes in the context of each conflict type.
There are a couple of interesting things to see here.</description>

      <description>In this subsection we were forced to present our fantastic maps as gifs since the resulting size of html code exceeded 500 MB and thus it was impossible to push it to the git repository.
We created interactive maps in Bokeh to see how conflicts in Africa are related to the location. Based on them we have the opportunity to investigate the relative position of the countries, their size, and other geographical properties.</description>

      <description>Interactive barplots with a number of conflicts or number of fatalities give us the possibility to see how conflicts and deaths are distributed during the time, how the situation looks in different countries, and which type of conflicts are the most common.
Both visualizations with selecting countries give us an opportunity to investigate the situation in one specific country in which we are interested. Each of the users can have their own interests and knowledge thus they can pick what to look at and interpret in their own way.</description>
